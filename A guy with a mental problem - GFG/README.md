# A guy with a mental problem
## Easy
<div class="problem-statement">
                <p></p><p><span style="font-size:18px">A guy has to reach his home and does not want to be late. He takes train to reach home. He has a mental illness, so he always switches train at every station.<br>
<strong>For eg</strong>: If he starts with train A then at station 2 he will switch his train to train B and so on. Similarly, if he starts with train B then he will switch to train A at station 2 and so on. Please help him to find the minimum total time he would take to reach his home.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Example 1:</strong></span></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input:</strong>
N = 3
A[] = {2, 1, 2}
B[] = {3, 2, 1}
<strong>Output:</strong>
5
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
If he chose train A initially, then time to
reach home will be : 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 
If he Chose train B initially, then time to
reach home will be : 3 + 1 + 1 = 5
5 is minimum hence the answer.</span></pre>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Your Task:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br>
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function <strong>minTime()</strong>&nbsp;which takes the array <strong>A[]</strong>, <strong>B[]</strong> and its size <strong>N </strong>as inputs and returns the <strong>minimum total time in seconds</strong> to reach home.</span></p>

<span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Expected Time Complexity:</strong> O(N)<br>
<strong>Expected Auxiliary Space:</strong> O(1)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Constraints:</strong><br>
1 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>6</sup><br>
1 ≤ Ai, Bi ≤ 10<sup>6</sup></span></p>
